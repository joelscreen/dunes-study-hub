                The National Identity Mark (NIM) in the UAE is an annual inspection and evaluation framework launched in 2023 by the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK). Its purpose is to evaluate how effectively private schools in Abu Dhabi foster a deep-rooted understanding of Emirati culture, values, and citizenship among students.

                    Key Aspects of the NIM Evaluation
                    <li>Independent Evaluation: The NIM is assessed separately from the annual Irtiqa'a inspections, which cover general school performance.</li>
                    <li>4-Tiered Rating System: Schools are ranked as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Weak based on their performance across the three domains.</li>
                    <li>Targeted Schools: While initially targeting schools with high Emirati enrollment, the framework encourages all private schools to integrate these elements.</li>
                    <li>Methodology: Evaluators use a mix of school visits, lesson observations, review of documents, and direct interaction with students, teachers, and staff to evaluate the impact on school culture.</li>
