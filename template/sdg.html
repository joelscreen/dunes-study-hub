                The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 global goals established by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal "call to action" to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all by 2030. Also known as the Global Goals, they are integrated, meaning action in one area affects others. 
                United Nations Development Programme <br>
                Key Aspects of the SDGs:<br>
